    <h1>All About Lamborghini</h1>
    
    <h2>How It All Started</h2>
    
    <p>Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the objective of producing a refined grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari. The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were released in the mid 1960s </p>
    
    <h2>Audi and Lamborghini</h2>
    
    <p>Volkswagen subsidiary Audi AG acquired Lamborghini in September 1998 for around US$110 million.</p>
    
    <h2>Latest Edition</h2>
    
    <h3>The Urus</h3>
    
    <p>While high-performance crossovers have existed for some time, the Urus looks to ignite a more exotic breed of hi-po SUV. Its dizzying price tag and menacing exterior design make the high-riding Lamborghini trendy transportation for professional athletes and celebrities. However, the Urus isn't all show and no go. Its 641-hp twin-turbo V-8 powertrain and standard all-wheel drive produce thundering sounds and otherworldly acceleration. Along with the agility and feedback of a sports car, this Lambo can tow heavy loads and tackle unmapped roads. Despite sharing parts with less expensive corporate siblings such as the Audi Q7 and Q8, the 2020 Urus is an incredibly entertaining and versatile machine.</p>
